> You've just landed your dream job as a DevOps Engineer at a cutting-edge startup, and your first task is to deploy a new Kubernetes cluster. But wait a minute, there's a twist. You're not going to do it. The AI is going to do it for you. Welcome to the future of DevOps.

In this scenario, the DevOps Engineer is tasked with deploying a new Kubernetes cluster, but instead of manually configuring the systems and services, they rely on AI to handle the deployment. The AI uses pre-trained models to understand the requirements and configurations of the cluster, and can access systems over SSH to deploy the cluster without human intervention.

The AI starts by analyzing the infrastructure and networking requirements, and then determines the optimal configurations for the systems and services. It then deploys the necessary components, such as the control plane, worker nodes, and network plugins, in a way that ensures high availability and scalability.

Once the cluster is deployed, the AI continues to monitor and optimize the systems and services, ensuring that they are running efficiently and effectively. If any issues arise, the AI can assess and solve the problems without human intervention, freeing up the DevOps Engineer to focus on more strategic tasks.

The AI can also be used to help train human operators, providing them with insights and recommendations on how to optimize the cluster and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This leads to cost savings for the company, as the AI can handle much of the DevOps work, freeing up human operators to focus on higher-level tasks.

This scenario demonstrates how AI is revolutionizing the way DevOps is done, leading to faster and more efficient deployments, and freeing up human operators to focus on more strategic tasks. This is just the beginning, and the future of DevOps looks very bright, indeed.
